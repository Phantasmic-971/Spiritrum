The Spectrum Mod started as a joke mod that adds a bit of content with old sprites I made in the past years.
but it soon changed to a regular mod with lore.

Hotfix:
Removed all Rebornium content
Fixed a bug where GEoT mode literally disabled mana (Now sets to 0 and gives -400 mana regen)

114 Items
42 weapons
6 tools
3 armor set
7 buffs
34 accesories
